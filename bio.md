Joe Wright is a tech lead who specialises in helping teams with legacy codebases. He targets the culture of teams, helping them overcome what they fear while improving their technical capabilities.

He ran the first Code Retreat in Western Europe in 2009 and dabbled with the Randori technique for coding dojos. It was 2015 when he joined a team using mob programming for real work and has since introduced new teams to mob programming.

In 2017, Joe concentrated on creating work environments suited to mob programming. After seeing some success, he focused on introducing  local technical communities to the technique. Using some simple rules and a daily five minute retrospective.

Joe is an ex-ThoughtWorker, founder of the CodeCraft conference and the Nevergreen open source project.
