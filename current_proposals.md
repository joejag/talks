# Tackling 16 years of legacy code with mob programming and Lego

Picture the scene. You’ve joined a new team that works on the most important product in the company. There’s just one catch. The codebase is using 2002 technology and the attitude has been “get it done” since then.

Things need to change fast. To reduce the amount of work in process you adopt mob programming – where the whole team works on only one task together on one computer – and start creating a culture of safety over fear. Things start to feel better but you can’t help but feel that you're being distracted from your goal.

In this case study you will learn about how a team can go from individuals to a mob. You’ll also hear how the most powerful improvement tool the team found was to use Lego to represent time spent. After this, you’ll know about mob programming, making problems visual with Lego and how that combination doubled the productivity for this team in 6 months.
